dnd_or_not - Auto-updating statuses based on where I am
==========

What is it
----------
The problem is to be able to communicate free-busy status updates based on time (and timezone)
and location (and type of location) to the web without revealing too much information.

This is kind of a "personal API" (see this article - http://readwrite.com/2013/08/23/building-personal-api)
on how you should contact me.
